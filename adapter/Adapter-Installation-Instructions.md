# Adapter Installation Instructions

## Direct Adapter

Step 1: Secure the direct adapter to the end of the robotic arm with matching flange distance using screws of the correct size.

Step 2: Fasten the direct adapter to the Wuji Hand using M4x6 screws.

## Impact-Resistant Adapter

The impact-resistant adapter consists of two parts. Under normal operation, the two parts are rigidly connected; during overload, they separate. For clarity, the part connected to the robotic arm is referred to as the "robotic arm module," and the part connected to the Wuji Hand is referred to as the "Wuji Hand module."

Step 1: Use the provided pry tool to separate the robotic arm module from the Wuji Hand module. (If already separated, skip this step.)

Step 2: Secure the robotic arm module to the end of the robotic arm with matching flange distance using screws of the correct size.

Step 3: Fasten the Wuji Hand module to the Wuji Hand using M4x6 screws.

The connection between the two modules can be performed either before or after Step 3.
